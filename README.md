question 1
Please implement the following mathematical function, in the way you think is best (explain your choice).

F(0) = 0
F(n) = n + F(n-1)
n=1..20

question 2
Please use the C++ STL vector class to make a triangle list class, for use in 3d drawing. For each triangle please store 3 vertex positions, 3 colours, and 1 face normal.

question 3
Please fill in the rest of the C++ 'slow_string' class written below. Try to replicate the STL string class's functionality as much as possible. This question is to test how good you are at encapsulating the C standard library functions such as strXXX. 

class slow_string
{
	char *data;
public:
	...
}

question 4
Please implement the standard functionality required from a 3 element vector for a math library. The design should be object oriented and protect its data members from public access. Please support simple operations on the vector such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as well as dot and cross product.
